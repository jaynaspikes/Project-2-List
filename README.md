Doubly-Linked List Container
Getting familiar with the concept of class template and its usage. 
Use of nested (iterator) classes. Use of namespace. Operator overloading. 
Implemented a doubly-linked list class template List and its associated iterators, 
with the same interface and iterator usage as found in the C++ STL.
